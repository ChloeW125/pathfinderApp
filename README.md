## 1. Project Title: Pathfinder app

A web application to help students efficiently and effectively navigate the University of Waterloo campus using clear, specific directions and leveraging the tunnel and bridge systems.


## 2. Project Description

- Overview:
The University of Waterloo campus can be challenging to navigate, especially for new students. With short class gaps and complex routes, existing navigation tools like Google Maps or Apple Maps often fall short in providing efficient and accurate directions. Pathfinder app aims to solve this problem by offering a dedicated campus navigation tool.
- Key Features:
Precise navigation instructions between buildings and classrooms.
Utilization of the campus's unique tunnel and bridge systems.
Specific pictures on each door and entry to make sure the user can find it.
- Technologies:
The project will use graph-based algorithms to model the campus layout and determine optimal routes. Static maps and simple and engaging graphics will form the backbone of the application's user interface.
- Future Goals:
Add directions to study spaces, eateries, and residences.
Enhance graphics to create an immersive and visually appealing experience.
Interactive map feature to view the whole campus map.
